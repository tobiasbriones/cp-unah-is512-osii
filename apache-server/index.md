## Get Started

For this project, there are the following requirements:

- Domain Name.
- VM.
- Website to Deploy.

I chose to use Porkbun for acquiring the domain name, Digital Ocean for the 
VM, and [Coniestica](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/ep-coniestica) (an EP 
I use to use for these scenarios). 

I opted for this config because I want to 
make some test to those platforms, I have expertise on domain names, and 
Porkbun has super cheap prices. Digital Ocean is more mature now, and I've 
seen they have managed databases, so it is a good chance to check out over 
there.
